This plug-in is here to help. \r\n\r\nJust pass in a year, presumably from the entry date of an entry, and this will return the year for display only if it does not match the current year. It can also prepend or append strings to the output to give you the proper formatting for your dates that do display the year.\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\nIt requires 1 parameter and had 2 optional parameters:\r\n\r\n'year' is required. This is typically the year of the entry you are displaying.\r\n\r\n'foreword' and 'afterword' are optional and are strings that will be added before or after the returned year, if a year is returned at all. \r\n\r\nNOTE: ExpressionEngine trims whitespace from parameter values, so in order to use spaces in 'foreword' and 'afterword' we need a special token. This token is the word \"SPACE\" and it will be replaced with an actual space character when returned.\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------\r\n\r\nFor example let's assume you have an entry created on January 1, 2012. Within a channels entry loop returning that entry, you would do something like this:\r\n\r\n{entry_date format='%F %j'}{exp:showpastyearsonly year='{entry_date format='%Y'}' foreword=',SPACE'}\r\n\r\nDuring 2012, this would return:\r\n\r\nJanuary 1\r\n\r\nAs soon as 2012 is over, it will return:\r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 2012\r\n\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions, please drop me a line at john@johnfmorton.com.\r\n\r\nIf you like this add-on, you may also like my commerical add-on,  Pic Puller: the Instagram Add-on for ExpressionEngine at http://devot-ee.com/add-ons/pic-puller-for-instagram.\r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\n-John"}
